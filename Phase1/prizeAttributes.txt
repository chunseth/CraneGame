Core physics attributes (drive real-time feel)

Size (bounding box or convex hull)
Mass / weight (kg)
    primaryMass (kg) – total mass for quick look-ups.
    massNodes[] – an array of nodes, each with { position: Vec3, massFraction: 0-1 }.
    position is local to the prize mesh’s origin.
    massFraction values sum to 1.0 (or use kg directly).
    inertiaTensorOverride (optional matrix) – if you want to hand-tune spin behavior.
Static friction coefficient (claw begins to slide)
Dynamic friction coefficient (sliding in motion)
Restitution / bounciness (how much it rebounds)
Center-of-mass offset (makes oddly weighted toys tip or spin)
Grab points (specific mesh vertices that register “good grip”)
Compliance / squish factor (how far cloth or plush compresses)
Shape complexity (sphere vs irregular: affects how easily the claw fits)

Display cues: scale the 3-D mesh directly for size; subtly vary texture roughness/normal maps for friction; 
use a small holographic overlay showing center-of-mass dot; animate a compression preview when player hovers 
so they “feel” the squishiness.


Skill-testing modifiers (increase difficulty variety)

Surface material tag (e.g., velvet, plastic, rubber) that modifies grip strength
Rotation inertia / angular damping (how fast the prize spins when nudged)
Aerodynamic drag (for lightweight plushies tossed by air blasts)
Magnetism / metal parts (allow special magnetic claw upgrades later)
“Hook point” count (number of places the claw can latch onto)
Temperature or stickiness effects (rare event items: ice-coated, gooey)
Off-axis weight: a plush elephant with a heavy ceramic nose tips forward when lifted.
Dual-weight items: capsule with a coin inside rolls unpredictably.
Long objects: a toy sword’s COM sits near the hilt, so gripping the blade end is unstable.

Display cues: material presets change shader (shinier plastic, fuzzy plush); 
show particle FX (ice mist, sticky gloss) or small UI icons next to the model.


Meta-game stats (progression & economy)

Rarity tier (common → legendary)
Token cost or payout multipliers
XP awarded on capture
Collection set ID (encourages completing themed series)
Condition / durability (may degrade if dropped too many times)

Display cues: rarity color halo, floating text tag, or card-style overlay.


AI/behavior attributes (advanced)

Self-movement pattern (wind-up toys that jitter inside pit)
Reactive torque (spins when touched)
Weight shift timer (inflatable toys slowly deflate)

Display cues: idle animations baked into the model; tooltip describing special behavior.
