Here’s a practical, end-to-end roadmap you can follow to ship a production-ready 
“online crane game arcade” built with React and Tailwind. The steps are grouped by 
logical phases; many can run in parallel inside the same sprint once foundations 
are in place.

PHASE 1 – Foundations
1. Requirements & scope
    Define the minimum-viable gameplay loop (e.g., insert token → control crane → 
        prize drop sequence → outcome → inventory update).
    List prize attributes: size, weight, friction coefficient, rarity, payout odds, 
        image/3-D model, inventory count, etc.
    Decide on real-time versus turn-based sessions (web-sockets vs simple REST).
    Specify legal/monetization rules (e.g., token purchase with Stripe, regional 
        gambling compliance).
2. Tech stack & repo setup
    Front-end: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (fast dev server) + Tailwind CSS + 
        Framer Motion / GSAP for animations.
    Physics: ammo.js, matter.js or planck.js (2-D) OR cannon-es (lightweight 3-D).
    Real-time: Socket.IO or tRPC subscriptions (WebSocket transport). 
        //turn based sessions, not applicable
    Back-end: Node (Express / NestJS) or full-stack tRPC; PostgreSQL for relational 
        data; Redis for transient game state.
    Auth: NextAuth.js or Clerk.
    Payments: Stripe.
    Monorepo tooling: pnpm workspaces or TurboRepo.
    CI/CD: GitHub Actions → Vercel / Netlify (front-end) + Fly.io / Render (back-end).
    Initialize repo, commit Husky + lint-staged, ESLint, Prettier.

PHASE 2 – Core UI & Visuals
3. Design system
    Configure Tailwind theme tokens for arcade brand colors, shadows, neon glows.
    Build reusable components: Button, Modal, TokenCounter, PrizeCard, UserAvatar, 
        CraneCanvas.
4. Canvas/3-D layer
    Use @react-three/fiber if going 3-D; otherwise HTML5 Canvas with pixi.js.
    Load clamp/grabber, prizes, and environment assets.
    Integrate camera controls and lighting; apply baked textures for performance.
5. Animation polish
    Entry motion: machine slides into view, lights blink (Framer Motion variants).
    Idle breathing: slight arm sway, ambient glows.
    UI transitions: spring-based token decrement/increment, prize fly-to-inventory 
        effect.

PHASE 3 – Physics & Gameplay Logic
6. Physics engine integration
    Spawn world, gravity vector, broadphase collisions.
    Translate joystick/arrow key inputs into crane arm movement constraints.
    Gripper logic: “close” command samples overlapping bodies; apply grip strength 
        vs weight/friction to determine drop probability.
    Tune damping, restitution, and contact materials to mimic plushy behavior.
7. Determinism & fairness layer
    Inject a seeded RNG to keep server-authoritative results auditable.
    Mix deterministic physics with random nudge (wind, claw slip) for skill-luck balance.
    Server validates or re-simulates final state to prevent client tampering.

PHASE 4 – Token Economy & Transactions
8. Token smart model
    Table: Users(id, email, token_balance).
    Actions: purchaseTokens (Stripe webhook → credit balance), spendToken (startGame), 
        refundToken (abort / error).
    Protect with per-user mutex to avoid race conditions.
9. Marketplace & pricing rules
    Admin dashboard to load new token packs, set discounts.
    Optional blockchain layer: ERC-20 style token contract if you want on-chain portability 
        (complexity ↑).

PHASE 5 – Game Session Management
10. Matchmaker / room server
    User spends 1 token → server creates Room with physics seed, prize arrangement, timeout.
    User joins WebSocket room; server streams authoritative crane position + world state 
        diff.
    After drop, server decides win/lose, player inventory table updated, prize inventory 
        decremented, broadcast results.
11. Latency mitigation
    Client predicts crane X-Y movement; server corrects via occasional snapshots.
    Use 60 fps local simulation; compress deltas (e.g., q-bit packs).

PHASE 6 – Prize & Inventory System
12. Prize catalog CRUD
    Admin UI to upload images/GLTF, set difficulty coefficients, stock count.
    API: GET /prizes public, POST /prizes admin-only.
13. Player inventory & showcase
    Table: PlayerPrizes(playerId, prizeId, wonAt, status {shipped, pending}).
    Profile page grid with filters, sharing link.

PHASE 7 – UX Flows & Edge Cases
14. Onboarding, tutorial overlay, sound effects toggle.
15. Error handling: token refund on disconnect, graceful reconnection.
16. Accessibility: keyboard controls, focus rings, alt text, color contrast.

PHASE 8 – Observability & Scaling
17. Metrics: game-start, wins, drop rate, avg session length, revenue; pipe to 
        Grafana / Amplitude.
18. Logging: pino/ Winston JSON logs, per-room trace id.
19. Load test physics service with Artillery / k6, autoscale pods.

PHASE 9 – QA & Compliance
20. Unit tests (Vitest/Jest), physics invariants, API contract tests.
21. E2E tests: Playwright script to finish a game and win dummy prize.
22. Security: OWASP checks, Stripe PCI, rate limiting, JWT expiry.

PHASE 10 – Launch & Post-Launch
23. Beta rollout with feature flags (prize rarity tuning).
24. Collect telemetry, balance difficulty values.
25. Seasonal events, new prize drops, leaderboard, social sharing.
